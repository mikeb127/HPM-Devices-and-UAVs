# HPM-Devices-and-UAVs
A quick analysis of the threat posed to UAV's from High Power Microwave Devices. There seemed to be a limited amount of information on this stuff out there, so I thought I would share in case anyone else had similar questions.

It's partially a work in progress and very raw (will likely be spelling mistakes etc). I may not do any more work on this as I currently don't have a HPM device to test my designs and I would say that the US Air Force is unlikely to lend me one. I will see how I go through.
